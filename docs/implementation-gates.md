# Implementation gates

The loopback local adapter is usable for local development and testing. Hosted
operation remains fail-closed until the production identity and session gates
below are complete.

Before enabling real MCP mutations:

1. Configure Better Auth as the OAuth authorization server with CIMD, PKCE, consent, and the workspace OIDC provider.
2. Derive `workspaceId` and `ownerUserId` only from verified token claims.
3. Apply the Drizzle schema and require both identifiers in every session query.
4. Encrypt any cached continuation credential with versioned server-side keys.
5. Resolve Eve's idempotency capability. If no deterministic start key exists, persist `submission_unknown` and never redispatch automatically.
6. Replace the loopback-only service in `lib/eve/service.ts` with the authenticated `eve/client` adapter using Vercel OIDC and manual redirects.
7. Map only installed Eve `0.38.3` events through the public allowlist and prove cursor behavior.
8. Complete the MCP Apps host bridge. The iframe must invoke tools through the host, never call Eve or private endpoints directly.
9. Pass cross-tenant, OAuth-negative, disclosure, cancellation, and lost-response tests.

Do not advertise exactly-once starts or a production installation until these gates have evidence.
