# Local development lifecycle

`mise run dev` is the fast, live-code loop: edit the checkout, let Next HMR or the affected Eve/package process reload, and retry the behavior. Do not rebuild artifacts, reinstall the plugin, run broad suites, publish, or deploy after each edit.

Vercel Sandbox is the execution backend. Use project-scoped OIDC, supported Sandbox source/file APIs, and structured commands. Do not add static keys, fallback runtimes, shell wrappers, or provider-internals checks. The checkout and generated files are writable.

Dependency setup is runtime work, not a source-integrity proof. Reuse caches when convenient; misses and stale entries rebuild normally. App or Arrusted edits do not require dependency rebuilding. New source snapshots are expected, not drift failures.

Only protect credentials and cross-user session data, obtain approval before outward effects, and report actual Sandbox/GitHub/Git/repository-command failures. There are no exact template, SHA/tree, package-layout, tool-version, manifest, path, receipt, digest, quota, or cache gates in local development. Inspection is best-effort and must not become a blocker.

Use the integrated Browser for loopback prototypes, never an MCP App preview. Run one final local walkthrough when ready; let CI perform broad verification.

## Synthetic web authentication and provider connections

The default development command remains the fast HTTP MCP loop. For the normal
web product with synthetic authentication, add `--emulated-web true` to
`mise run dev -- --arrusted-root /absolute/arrusted --state-root /absolute/private/state`.
This reuses the existing emulated web acceptance preparation: local PostgreSQL
and migrations, GitHub/Vercel emulators, passkey onboarding and auth settings.
It preserves the local Eve adapter and project-scoped Sandbox OIDC. No live
provider connection or publication occurs during setup.

This mode uses `https://localhost:<next-port>` consistently for the web UI, MCP,
OAuth callbacks and passkeys. Docker and the repository's installed tools must
be available. Existing locally trusted TLS files are required: by default
`certificates/localhost.pem` and `certificates/localhost-key.pem`; override them
with `--web-certificate PATH` and `--web-key PATH`. Supply `--web-ca PATH` or reuse
`CAROOT`/the existing cached Next mkcert `-CAROOT`. This command never installs
system trust or disables TLS verification. Missing prerequisites report an
explicit setup error; the mode does not silently fall back to HTTP.

Runtime certificates, emulator configuration and persistent database files live
under the selected state root. When omitted in this mode, the state root defaults
to a stable private temporary directory outside the checkout. The development command stops its owned local
processes and any database it started, retaining data for the next invocation;
it does not stop a previously running database. The existing auth acceptance
lane keeps its original defaults and reset lifecycle. Configure its existing
local database/emulator port settings through mise when another local stack
already owns those ports. Separate clients must trust the supplied local CA;
browser trust alone does not establish Node/Codex client trust. Owned MCP
readiness verifies the explicit CA and never grants that CA to remote origins.
